# SharedAES-GCM
Attempt for a cross platform AES-GCM encryption

# About
Due to steps by integrating some crypto standards I found no compatible open source C/C++ implementation for AES-GCM to use in native Java, Android and iOS.

I created my own wrapper as reusable pod/header here.

# Implementation
Based on public domain implementation from Steve Gibson of GRC.com.

See [Sources/README.txt](https://github.com/mko-x/SharedAES-GCM/blob/master/Sources/README.txt) for more info.

Thanks for fixes by [@maximmasiutin](https://github.com/maximmasiutin).
